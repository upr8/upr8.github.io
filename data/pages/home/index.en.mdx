I'm [***Saeed Asaiyan***](/en/about).

I've had many different versions of a home page over the years. I tried to collect
all my notes on different things in one page. Hopefully this will be a place for
me to share some of the more interesting things I make and do and even if it's
not much interest to anyone else, hopefully I'll like it. Keep up to date with the [RSS feed](/en/rss.xml).

The site is built with [Astro](https://astro.build/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/),
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/),
and you can see and use its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/upr8/upr8.github.io).
