## Performance evaluation

### Runtime

One of the methods for scpecifying the runtime of an application (Program?) is to use SECONDS valriable.

```bash
SECONDS=0; sleep 3; echo $SECONDS;
```

## Condition

### Conditional structure

The general structure of a conditional statement in Bash is as follows:

```bash
val=14
if test $val -eq 14 ; then
    echo "exit value of a command"
elif (( $val + 6 > 20 )); then
    echo "Mathematical expressions"
elif [ $val -gt 10 ] ; then
    echo "single bracket (POSIX standard)"
elif [[ $val -gt 10 ]]; then
    echo "double bracket (Bash and some others)"
else
    echo "else condition"
fi
```

### Comparison conditions

#### File Operators 
The conditional operators for checking the status of files are visible in the table below:

| Operator | Example | Description |
|:--------:|:--------|:------------|
| `-e`     | `-e $fileName`      | Checks if a file exists.                           |
| `-d`     | `-d $directoryName` | Checks if a file exists and it is a directory.     |
| `-f`     | `-f $fileName`      | Checks if a file exists and it is a regular file.  |
| `-h`     | `-h $linkName`      | Checks if a file exists and it is a symbolic link. |
| `-r`     | `-r $fileName`      | Checks if a file is readable.                      |
| `-W`     | `-W $fileName`      | Checks if a file is writable.                      |
| `-X`     | `-X $fileName`      | Checks if a file is executable.                    |
| `-s`     | `-S $fileName`      | Checks if size of a file is non-zero.              |

#### String Operators 
Conditional operators for comparing strings is visible in the table below:

| Operator | Example  | Description |
| :------: | :------: | :--------------------- |
| `-z` | `-z $str`        | Check if the length of the string is zero. |
| `-n` | `-n $str`        | Check if the length of the string is not zero.|
| `==` | `$str1 == $str2` | Check if the two strings are the same.|
| `!=` | `$str1 != $str2` | Check if the two strings are not the same.|
| `>`  | `$str1 > $str2`  | Check if str1 is lexicographically greater than str2. |
| `<`  | `$str1 < $str2`  | Check if str1 is lexicographically less than str2. |

#### Arithmatic Operators 
Arithmatic comparisons can be performed using the following operators:

| Operator | Example |  Description |
| :------: | :-----: | :------------------------------- |
| `-eq`    | `$int1 -eq $int2` |           Check if int1 and int2 are equal. |
| `-ne`    | `$int1 -ne $int2` |         Check if int1 and int2 are not equal. |
| `-gt`    | `$int1 -gt $int2` |  Check if int1 is greater than int2.|
| `-ge`    | `$int1 -ge $int2` |  Check if int1 is greater than or equal to int2.|
| `-lt`    | `$int1 -lt $int2` |     Check if int1 is less than int2. |
| `-le`    | `$int1 -le $int2` | Check if int1 is less than or equal to int2. |


### Conditional execution

If execution of the first command was successfull, the second command will be executed:

```bash
true && echo "this message should show"
```

If a command encounters an error, another command will be executed:

```bash
false || echo "this message should show"
```

If the previous command or function returned an error code, the next command will be executed:

```bash
false
[[ $? -ne 0 ]] && echo "this message should show"
```

## Loops

The following two loops have the same functionality:

```bash
for i in `seq 1 10`
do
    echo "\$i is $i"
done

for s in foo bar baz
do
    echo $s
done

for (( i = 0; i < 10; i++ ))
do
    echo "\$i is $i"
done
```

## Working with arrays

```bash
array=(zero one two three)
echo "${array[0]}"          # shows the first element
echo "${array[-1]}"         # shows the last element
echo "${array[@]}"          # shows all elements
echo "${array[@]:1:2}"      # shows two elements (:2), starting from element with index of 1 (which is the 2nd element (:1))
array[4]='fifth element'    # inserts an element at index 4
echo "${array[4]}"
array+=('sixth')            # appends an element to array
unset -v 'array[2]'         # deletes element with index of 2 from array
array=("${array[@]}")       # re-indexing an array
echo "${#array[@]}"         # shows the length of array
```

To add an element to index 3 of an array, use the following code:

```bash
array=("${array[@]:0:2}" '2.5' "${array[@]:2}")
echo "${array[2]}" #output: new
echo "${array[@]}"
```
Extract an array from a string(?):

```bash
theStr="Zero,One,Two"
array=(${theStr//,/ })
echo ${array[0]}
echo ${array[2]}
```

Reading elements of an array:

```bash
array=(1 2 3 4)
# foreach loop
for y in "${array[@]}"; do
    # act on $y
    echo "$y"
done

# for loop with index
for ((idx=0; idx < ${#array[@]}; ++idx)); do
    # act on ${array[$idx]}
    echo "${array[$idx]}"
done
```

Recieving the output of a command as an array, and then reading that array using Foreach loop(?):

```bash
array=($(tr ',' ' ' <<<"0,1,2,3,4"))
for y in "${array[@]}"; do
    echo "$y"
done
```

Filling an array based on the output of a command:

```bash
while read -r; do
    #array+=("$REPLY")     # Array append
    array[$i]="$REPLY"     # Assignment by index
    let i++                # Increment index
done < <(seq 1 10)  # command substitution
echo ${array[@]}    # output: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
```

## Working with Map (Associative Array)

The first step is to create a _map_(?):

```bash
declare -A mp       # declare (This line is mandatory)
mp[hello]=world     # insert
mp["a long key"]=v  # insert with a long key
echo ${mp[hello]}   # access
echo "${!mp[@]}"    # access all keys
echo "${mp[@]}"     # access all values
echo "${#mp[@]}"    # count of elements in a map

for key in "${!mp[@]}"; do # Iterate Over map
    echo "Key:   ${key}"
    echo "Value: ${mp[$key]}"
done

unset mp            # destroy a map/array
```

## working with file:

Reading a file line by line and converting it into an array:

```bash
IFS=$'\n' read -r -a arr < file
```

Reading an entire file until reaching an empty line:

```bash
while read line || [ -n "$line" ]; do
    echo $line
done < file
```

## Processing input parameters

If no parameter is passed to _for_ loop, it will be executed on the input file. 
The following two loops have the same results:

```bash
for arg; do
    echo arg=$arg
done

for arg in "$@"; do
    echo arg=$arg
done
```

The following code from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/16496491) demonstrates various
use casess for utilizing _getopts_ for processing input parameters:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
usage() { echo "Usage: $0 [-s <45|90>] [-p <string>]" 1>&2; exit 1; }

while getopts ":s:p:" o; do
    case "${o}" in
        s)
            s=${OPTARG}
            ((s == 45 || s == 90)) || usage
            ;;
        p)
            p=${OPTARG}
            ;;
        *)
            usage
            ;;
    esac
done
shift $((OPTIND-1))

if [ -z "${s}" ] || [ -z "${p}" ]; then
    usage
fi
```
