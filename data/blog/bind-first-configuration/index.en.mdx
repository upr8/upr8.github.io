## Introduction

BIND is one of the oldest and most widely used DNS server software.
It has been around for many years and has evolved into a stable and reliable solution.
Its long history and extensive use in production environments make it a trusted choice.

BIND offers a wide range of features, making it suitable for various DNS server configurations.
It supports both authoritative and recursive modes, DNSSEC for enhanced security,
dynamic updates, zone transfers, IPv6, and more.
BIND also provides extensive logging and statistics capabilities for monitoring
and troubleshooting.

BIND allows fine-grained control over DNS configurations.
It supports complex zone configurations, including the ability to define different
types of records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, etc.) and DNSSEC-related records.
You can customize BIND to meet your specific requirements and integrate it into
existing network setups.

## Installation

### Installation of BIND for Debian distribution

```bash
sudo apt -y install bind9 bind9utils dnsutils
```

## General configuration

### Applying configuration structure

The main configuration file for BIND is typically located at `/etc/named.conf` or `/etc/bind/named.conf`.
This file contains global server options and specifies zone configurations.
Make sure to take a backup of the original file before making any changes.

Configurations can be divided into four main categories:
- General configurations in the `named.conf.options` section 
- Configuration of log files in the `named.conf.logs` section 
- Configurations of displaying domain for internal networks in the `named.conf.internal-zones` section 
- Configurations for public and external networks in the `named.conf.external-zones`. 
Therefore, the `/etc/bind/named.conf` file will look like as follows:

```dns-zone
include "/etc/bind/named.conf.options";
include "/etc/bind/named.conf.logs";
include "/etc/bind/named.conf.internal-zones";
include "/etc/bind/named.conf.external-zones";
```

### named.conf.options: General service settings

General settings(`/etc/bind/named.conf.options`), also known as _options_, are configured as follows:

```dns-zone
options {
        directory "/var/cache/bind";

        recursion no;
        allow-transfer { none; };

        forwarders {
                8.8.8.8;
        };
        forward only;

        //========================================================================
        // If BIND logs error messages about the root key being expired,
        // you will need to update your keys.  See https://www.isc.org/bind-keys
        //========================================================================
        dnssec-validation auto;
        auth-nxdomain no;        // conform to RFC1035
        listen-on-v6 { any; };
};
```

### named.conf.internal-zones: internal network settings

```dns-zone
view "internal" {
        match-clients {
                localhost;
                192.168.1.0/24;
        };
        # set zone for internal
        zone "example.com" {
                type master;
                file "/etc/bind/zones/db.example.com";
        };
        # set zone for internal *note
        zone "1.168.192.in-addr.arpa" {
                type master;
                file "/etc/bind/zones/db.1.168.192";
        };
        include "/etc/bind/named.conf.default-zones";
};
```
### Sample Zone Files

BIND uses zone files to define DNS records for domains.
Each domain typically has two zone files: a forward zone file and a reverse zone file.

#### Forward zone settings

Configure the forward zone file (e.g., db.example.com or example.com.zone) to define the DNS records for your domain.
This includes specifying the domain name, nameservers, A records, CNAME records, MX records, etc.

For example, `/etc/bind/zones/db.example.com` can contain the following record:

```dns-zone
;
$TTL    604800
@       IN      SOA     ns1.example.com. admin.example.com (
                            1           ; Serial
                            604800      ; Refresh
                            86400       ; Retry
                            2419200     ; Expire
                            604800      ; Negative Cache TTL
                            )
;
@       IN      NS      ns1.example.com.

; edit this line!
edit-this     IN      A       192.168.1.80
```

#### Reverse zone settings

Configure the reverse zone file (e.g., db.1.168.192) to map IP addresses to domain names.
This is commonly used for reverse DNS lookup. Specify PTR records to map IP addresses to hostnames.

For example, `/etc/bind/zones/db.1.168.192` can contain the following record:

```dns-zone
;
$TTL    604800
@       IN      SOA     ns1.example.com. admin.example.com (
                            1           ; Serial
                            604800      ; Refresh
                            86400       ; Retry
                            2419200     ; Expire
                            604800      ; Negative Cache TTL
                            )
;
@       IN      NS      ns1.example.com.
1.      IN      PTR     ns1.example.com.
```

## Troubleshooting

### Validating "configuration file"

For configuration files validation, the following commands can be useful:

```bash
named-checkconf
```

```bash
named-checkzone example.com /etc/bind/zones/db.example.com
named-checkzone 1.0.0.in-addr.arpa /etc/bind/zones/db.127
```

### dig

To check if BIND is configured correctly, you can use the dig command-line tool,
which is commonly available on Linux systems.

#### Check if the DNS server is running

By using the following command, if the DNS server is running and reachable,
you will see the server's version and some query-related information:

```bash
dig @dns_server_ip
```

#### Perform a basic DNS lookup

This command queries your DNS server for the IP address associated with the domain "example.com".
You should receive a response with the IP address (A record) of the domain.

```bash
dig @dns_server_ip example.com
```

#### Reverse DNS lookup

The response should include the domain name (PTR record) associated with the IP address.

```bash
dig @dns_server_ip -x your_ip_address
```

### nslookup

To check if BIND is configured correctly using the nslookup command, you can follow these steps:

1. Start the `nslookup` command-line tool
    ```bash
    nslookup
    ```
2. By default, nslookup uses your system's configured DNS server for lookups.
    To specify a specific DNS server, use the following command, replacing "your_dns_server_ip"
    with the IP address of your DNS server:
    ```bash
    server your_dns_server_ip
    ```
3. Once you have set the DNS server, you can perform DNS lookups. Type the domain name you want to query, such as:
    ```bash
    example.com
    ```
    You will receive a response with various details, including the IP address (A record) associated
    with the domain, the authoritative DNS server, and additional records if available.
4. To query a specific record type, for example, to query the CNAME records for a domain, you would use:
    ```bash
    set type=CNAME
    ```
    Then, you can query the domain again to retrieve the specific record information.
    ```bash
    example.com
    ```
5. To exit the nslookup tool, type exit.
