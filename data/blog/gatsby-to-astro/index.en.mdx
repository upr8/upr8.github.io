It happened again.

After almost four years of using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), I
eventually felt the need to drop it from the list of technologies I quietly say
goodbye to. The feeling did not arrive suddenly. It accumulated slowly, almost
passively, every time I ran the install command and was greeted by a long list
of red warnings.

Dependencies with known vulnerabilities. No meaningful releases for a long time.
The number of warnings increasing over time instead of shrinking.

None of this broke the site immediately, but it created a constant background
noise, a sense that the project was aging in a way that demanded attention.

## When maintenance becomes friction

For a personal website, maintenance overhead matters more than feature power.
I do not need cutting-edge performance tricks or complex abstractions. I need
something that stays quiet when I am not thinking about it.

Gatsby slowly stopped being quiet.

At some point, ignoring the warnings felt more irresponsible than doing something
about them. So I decided to refactor the site and move to a different technology.

## Choosing the next tool

I had two realistic options: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) or [Astro](https://astro.build/).

Next.js was the safe and obvious choice. It is mature, popular, and well-supported.
But for personal projects, I often prefer the slightly odd option, not for
productivity, but for curiosity.

Astro caught my attention because of its focus on content-first sites and its
idea of [Islands Architecture](https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/islands-architecture/).
I wanted to understand how that model feels in practice, not just in theory.

### A brief explanation of Island Architecture

In simple terms, Island Architecture treats most of a website as
**static HTML by default**, and then adds interactivity only where it is truly
needed.

* The page is the "ocean": mostly static content.
* Small interactive components are the "islands": they are **hydrated independently** on the client.

Instead of shipping one big JavaScript bundle to power the whole page, you ship
small pieces of JavaScript only for the parts that require it (a search box, a
theme toggle, a dynamic chart). This often improves performance, but for me the
bigger win is conceptual: fewer moving parts, less global complexity.

So I chose Astro.

## A surprisingly uneventful migration

The migration took only a few hours.

That was both surprising and, honestly, a little disappointing. I had expected
friction, unexpected edge cases, or at least some small architectural puzzles to
solve. Instead, the process was smooth and mostly mechanical.

Pages moved cleanly. Content stayed intact. The mental overhead was minimal.

## Small wins that matter

During the migration, I finally took the opportunity to refactor the code block
syntax highlighting, something I had been postponing for a long time. It was a
small change, but it improved readability and maintainability more than I expected.

The final result felt calm. The site became easier to reason about, faster to
build, and quieter during installs.

## Closing thoughts

This refactor reminded me that technology choices do not always need dramatic
justifications. Sometimes, the right time to move on is simply when maintenance
starts to feel heavier than curiosity.

Astro did not amaze me with complexity or novelty. Instead, it surprised me by
staying out of the way, and that might be its strongest feature.
