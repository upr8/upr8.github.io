desc: 'A novel of obsession set in Vienna, Austria, in 1882, relating a fictional meeting between the doctor Josef Breuer and the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche. When distinguished physician Josef Breuer finds himself struggling with obsessive thoughts about a former patient, he agrees to meet with the poverty-ridden, unknown philosopher Nietzsche. Breuer must cure Nietzsche''s despair without his knowledge by posing as the patient himself and begging Nietzsche''s help. The ensuing month of daily talks becomes increasingly compelling as both men uncover their forgotten pasts and delve into unconscious desires and fears. With the revolutionary ideas of young Sigmund Freud influencing them, their dialogue becomes the origin of psychoanalysis and explains how Nietzsche received the inspiration to write "Thus Spoke Zarathustra."'
