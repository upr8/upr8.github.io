desc: 'A dystopian novel about a mysterious epidemic of "white blindness" that suddenly strikes an unnamed city. As the contagion spreads, society rapidly breaks down into chaos and violence. The story follows a group of quarantined victims, including the only person who mysteriously retains her sight. Through this allegory, Nobel Prize-winning author José Saramago explores themes of social breakdown, human dignity, compassion, and the fragility of civilization when stripped of its veneer.'
