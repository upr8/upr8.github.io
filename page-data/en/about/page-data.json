While my work naturally revolves around computer-related challenges, I believe in broadening my horizons beyond the confines of technology. I actively engage in studying diverse fields, including philosophy, sociology, and management. However, I approach these subjects with humility, recognizing that they primarily serve as opportunities for intellectual exploration and personal growth.\n\nThis website serves as a metaphorical backpackâ€”a repository of knowledge and experiences that I carry with me. It is a platform where I can freely share this amalgamation of content with others and refer back to it when needed. My intention is to create a space for exchange and learning, providing valuable insights and fostering meaningful discussions in the process.\n\n\n\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":"23 May, 2023","lang":"en","desc":"Who am I?"},"fields":{"slug":"/en/about/"}}},"pageContext":{"lang":"en","slug":"/en/about/","title":"$> who am i","desc":"About me","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":"2023-05-23","lang":"en","type":"single-page","published":true,"desc":"Who am I?","tags":["about"]}}},"staticQueryHashes":["768871489"],"slicesMap":{}}
