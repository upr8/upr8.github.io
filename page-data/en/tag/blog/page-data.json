I used different platforms and even last time I used the same\nplatform, namely github and Gatsby.js. I think there were several reasons why I\ndidn't continue blogging, and I think the most important reason was that this\nactivity was not a priority for me. There is a possibility that this blog will\nsuffer the same fate as the others, but for some reason, I think it is less\nlikely than the previous times. Or in other words, its priority has increased\nfor me.\n\nIn this blog, I plan to write about various areas that I am interested in and\nfollow: from programming in system and web environments to product design and\nmanagement. The summaries of the books I read and my opinions about various\nevents will probably form part of the content of this site.\n\nI got the name of this post from the title of the book \"Once again, a city I\nliked\" written by Nader Ebrahimi. One of the good books I read while staying at\nhome due to the Corona situation. Of course, the content of this post has\nnothing to do with this book and I remembered that book only when naming it.\n\nI hope this path continues...\n"}}]}},"pageContext":{"lang":"en","tag":"blog","title":"\"blog\"","desc":"List of content tagged with \"blog\"","slug":"/en/tag/blog","cover":""}},"staticQueryHashes":["768871489"],"slicesMap":{}}
