When distinguished physician Josef Breuer finds himself struggling with obsessive thoughts about a former patient, he agrees to meet with the poverty-ridden, unknown philosopher Nietzsche. Breuer must cure Nietzsche's despair without his knowledge by posing as the patient himself and begging Nietzsche's help. The ensuing month of daily talks becomes increasingly compelling as both men uncover their forgotten pasts and delve into unconscious desires and fears. With the revolutionary ideas of young Sigmund Freud influencing them, their dialogue becomes the origin of psychoanalysis and explains how Nietzsche received the inspiration to write "Thus Spoke Zarathustra."]]></description><link>https://www.asaiyan.com/en/library/when-nietzsche-wept</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.asaiyan.com/en/library/when-nietzsche-wept</guid><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment (2nd Edition)]]></title><link>https://www.asaiyan.com/en/library/advanced-programming-in-the-unix-environment</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.asaiyan.com/en/library/advanced-programming-in-the-unix-environment</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Essential Linux Device Drivers (Prentice Hall Open Source Software Development)]]></title><link>https://www.asaiyan.com/en/library/essential-linux-device-drivers-prentice-hall-open-source-software-development</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.asaiyan.com/en/library/essential-linux-device-drivers-prentice-hall-open-source-software-development</guid><pubDate>Fri, 20 Sep 2013 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Cryptography and Network Security: Principles and Practice]]></title><description><![CDATA[The history of cryptanalysis shows that a problem that seems insolvable from one perspective can be found to have a solution if looked at in an entirely different way.]]></description><link>https://www.asaiyan.com/en/library/cryptography-and-network-security-principles-and-practice</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.asaiyan.com/en/library/cryptography-and-network-security-principles-and-practice</guid><pubDate>Sun, 30 Dec 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Sorrows of Young Werther]]></title><description><![CDATA[A masterpiece tragedy!]]></description><link>https://www.asaiyan.com/en/library/the-sorrows-of-young-werther</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.asaiyan.com/en/library/the-sorrows-of-young-werther</guid><pubDate>Tue, 12 Jun 2012 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Digital Fortress]]></title><link>https://www.asaiyan.com/en/library/digital-fortress</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.asaiyan.com/en/library/digital-fortress</guid><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2011 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[1984]]></title><link>https://www.asaiyan.com/en/library/1984</link><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.asaiyan.com/en/library/1984</guid><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2009 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
